Hello! Guys
This is a mini project I did to download mulitple Images from konachan.net/konachan.com.
It has two modes Explicit and Safe. I guess you understand what they mean.
Set the starting page from where you want to download.
You have the Liberty of setting multiple pages for download at a time.

after the download botton is pressed you will be asked to choose the Destination Folder.

Thats it Guys. Have Fun!!
